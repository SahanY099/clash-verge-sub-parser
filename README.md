# clash-verge-sub-parser

Simple parser for clash verge rev configs to filter unwanted, useless proxies

## Getting Started

Simply copy and paste the contents of the main file in clash verge rev's script sections

## Development

If you want to tinker with the parser script you can run it by

```bash
npm run parse
```

A example configs can be provided in the index file. It could be anything you like. I have used a sample yaml config.
